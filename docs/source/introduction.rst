UFC Scraper
============

This project is a data scraper designed to collect and process fight statistics and betting odds for UFC events. It is composed of two parts:

1. **Scraping UFC Statistics**: Data from events, fights, and fighters is scraped from `UFC stats <http://ufcstats.com/>`_ and stored in CSV format.

2. **Scraping Betting Odds**: Betting odds for UFC fights are scraped from `BestFightOdds <https://bestifghtodds.com/>`_ and matched to the correct fighters.

The data model for the UFC statistics part can be found `here <tables/ufcstats_tables.html>`_ while the one for BestFightOdds odds can be found `here <tables/bestfightodds_tables.html>`_.
